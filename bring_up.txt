Upbrinning children.
Upbrinning children is a very difficult and responsible task. Parents can make
mistakes that can greatly affect the future of children.
It is a thin balans between permits and forbiddances.
We insist on learning and homework. First study then fun. But we never punish
our kids for bad marks in the school and always praise them.
We use encourages for children if they behave well. For example pizza, icecream,
going to the cinema or an interesting place for fun. That sort of things.
And we use pocket money.
We allow hanging out for older son. But only on weekends. All weekdays
are busy with studies and additional activities.
But we also use a punishes.
For exapmle. If they behaves badly, make a mess or were rude we ban watching
cartoons.
Apply restrictions on smartphone use for older son.

I want to raise strong and free people from children.
