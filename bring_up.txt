Upbrinning children is a very difficult and responsible task. Parents can make
mistakes that can greatly affect the future of children.
It is a thin balance between permits and prohibitions.
We insist on learning and homework. First study then fun. But we never punish
our kids for bad marks in the school and always praise them.
We use encourages for children if they behave well. For example pizza, icecream,
going to the cinema or an interesting place for fun. That sort of things.
And of course we use pocket money.
We allow hanging out for older son. But only on weekends. All weekdays
are busy with studies and additional activities.
But we also use a punishes.
For example. If they behaves badly, make a mess or were rude we forbid watching
cartoons.
We use restrictions for older son's smartphone.

I want to raise strong and free people from children.

I felt dizziness, wanted to straighten up and get out as soon as possible.
Unpleasant feeling. I do not want more but the children liked it
