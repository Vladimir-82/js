                                Memory.
Defensively. All the seven tips for improving memory are really useful.
But from my point of view the most effective are review information, sleep well
and do physical exercises.
- There is a law of seven repetitions. If you repeat something five times you
will remember it and never forgot it. But repetitions should be for a long
period of time. First repetition - in the next day. Second - in the week.
Third - another week later. Fourth - in the month. And the fifth repetition
should be half a year after studying. Every next repetition guarantees
memorization better and better.
- Sleep well is my favorite tip for improving my memory. Clearly. A man who
sleeps has a fresh mind, good mood. His brain ready to get some information.
- Strong body makes strong mind. When you exercise more oxygen goes to your
brain and that makes your memory works better. You trained body keeps you mind
fresh and clean.
In my opinion the least useful tip for improving memory is a cup of coffee.
Of course. Caffeine like exercise, sends oxygen to the brain and helps you
concentrate. But often drinking of coffee is addictive
and hurts your stomach.

The most useful tip in learning English - constant practice with a native
speaker. No one of tips for improving memory is better than this one.

I memorize new English words through repetition, listening and pronunciation.
I often listen to English speech.

Among ather tips for improving memory I can remember bitter chocolate and
strong black tee. Our bran really likes sweets.
Walk a lot in the pine forest is a grate tip to improve your memory. You brain
get more oxygen and enjoys nature.
