                                Memory.
Definitely. All the seven tips for improving memory are really useful.
But from my point of view the most effective are repetition, sleep well
and do physical exercises.
- There is a law of five repetitions. If you repeat something five times or
more you will remember it and never forgot it. But repetitions should be for a
long period of the time. First repetition - at the next day. Second - in the
week.
Third - another week later. Fourth - in the month. And the fifth repetition
should be half a year after studying. Every next repetition guarantees
memorization better and better.
- Sleep well is my favorite tip for improving my memory. Clearly. A man who
sleeps enough has a fresh mind and good mood. His brain ready to get some
information.
- Strong body makes strong mind. When you exercise more oxygen goes to your
brain and that makes your memory works better. Your trained body keeps your
mind fresh and clean.
In my opinion the least useful tip for improving memory is a cup of coffee.
Of course. Caffeine like exercise, sends oxygen to your brain and helps you
concentrate. But often drinking of coffee is addictive
and hurts your stomach.

The most useful tip in learning English - constant practice with a native
speaker. No one of tips for improving memory is better than this one.

I memorize new English words through repetition, listening and pronunciation.
I often listen to English speech.

Among other tips for improving memory I can remember bitter chocolate and
strong sweet black tee. Our brain really likes sweets.
Walk a lot in the pine forest is a grate tip to improve your memory. Your brain
get more oxygen and enjoys nature.
