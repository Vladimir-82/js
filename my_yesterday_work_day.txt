My yesterday's work day I spent as usual and nothing unusual.
First I developed another perpetual motion machine. Then between the
discovery of a new chemical element and the introduction of new renewable
energy sources, I had lunch.
Although. Something unusual happened after work
When I was walking home I heard a plaintive meow in the bushes.
I couldn't believe my eyes It was a snow-white fluffy kitten.
I decided to take him home. I called him Fluffy.
How cute he is. I'm so happy now!
