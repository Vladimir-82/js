My yesterday's work day I spent as usual and nothing unusual.
First I developed another perpetual motion machine. Then between the
discovery of a new chemical element and the introduction of new renewable
energy sources, I had lunch.
Although. Something unusual happened after work
On the way home, I heard a plaintive meow in the bushes. Later it became clear
that this is a snow-white fluffy kitten.
I decided to take him home. How cute he is. I'm happy now!
