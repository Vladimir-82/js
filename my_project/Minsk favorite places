                        If you visited Minsk
1 I'd definitely recommend to visit Trinity Suburb, bank of the river Svisloch,
Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Church of St. Simeon and Helena.
Are you young, want to hang out and have fun?
There ara a lot of night clubs, pubs and bars. You have got to go to Zybitskaya
or October street.

2 Have you got enough money, want to spend it and have fun?
You should definitely go to the one of the most famous market or shopping mall.
There are a lot of shops, cinemas and fun for kids.

Want nostalgic hard shopping?
You should definitely visit zhanovichi market.
You will plunge into the atmosphere of tents from 90-th. All modern and unusual
clothes and any fashion items are available here.
If you're hungry you can take a chance and try Vietnamese food at a local diner.

3 Want to relax? Its not worth visiting one of the amusement parks or aquaparks.

4 the most memorable historical place for me is the kurapaty grove.
In the thirties of the last century, thousands of Belarusians were shot there.
This shouldn't happen again.
