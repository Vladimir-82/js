                        My favorite holiday
I always spend my holiday with my family.
Last weekend started with breakfast. Then we went up the hill to ride tubings.
Hill is in Stepeanka calls "soldier". My kids rolled down the hill and laughed
and I also rolled down several times. It was really fun.
The first snow is always so popular with children. I also love the beginning
of winter.
In the late afternoon we were back on the hill.
Next day we went shopping for half a day. Bought clothes and food for the
whole week.
I spent the rest of the day with my children on a hill riding tubing.

Every new weekend is the best weekend.
For instance. Last weekend we were in the cinema and watched a cartoon.
In the middle of watching my younger son climbed under the chair and
interfered with the man who was sitting in front. He shouted at my sun and
turned away. My son was scared and sat in his mother's arms.
I sat a little further and decided to wait and not interfere with
watching. But everything was boiling inside.
After watching, it's time to scream to me.
Here the screamer was already scared and he had to apologize for his behavior.

Every new weekend is the best weekend.
