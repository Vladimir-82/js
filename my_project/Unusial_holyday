There are many places I would like to visit. One of them is Amazon river and
its rich river basin. The length of Amazon is almost 7000 km and. The river has
thousands of tributaries that merge into a huge beautiful river.
The river provides 20% of all river water in the world. The Amazon flows
through 6 countries of the world where live different people with various cultures.
And on the banks of its tributaries live wild people that have never been
in contact with civilization.
But the most interesting is the rich fauna and plants.
Most of the worlds flora and fauna lives in the Amazon basin.
Thousands of species of animals, plants, not only in the jungle, but also in the water.
I would like to see the anaconda and wild piranhas and enjoy the beautiful
views of the river.
