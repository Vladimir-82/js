But I realy want to chage my job and do a lot for this.
I have been studying English and a Python programming language for over a year.
And now I'm ready to take the next step towards my goal of finding
my dream job.
I have a family and two suns too. Theirs names are Arseny and Alex.
Arseny is very smart and curious and Alex  is a big sweet tooth.
My wifes name is Olga. She works at the fitness family center.

It was great to hear that you'r coming to Minsk next month. It would be fantastic
to see you again and meet with your family.

And children will find interesting games.
Let me know wich days you are going to be here and we can plan something special.

Grait to hear from you.
